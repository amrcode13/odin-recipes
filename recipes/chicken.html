<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>


<ul>
  <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
  <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
  <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>


<ol>
  <li>Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
  <li>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
  <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
</ol>
